This project is a Python program that presents the user with an interface with which to select images to download.
For now it's quite simple: you choose the category of the picture you want to browse (or randomise it) and then click "search". The image will be displayed on the interface and if you like what you see, press "download" and it will be downloaded to the directory of your choice.
This is just an initial version, and I'm planning to add more features to it.
